# 18 NoSQL: Social Network API

## Description 

This is an API for a social network web application built using Express.js for routing, MongoDB as the database, and the Mongoose ODM. The goal of this application is to allow users to share their thoughts, react to their friends' thoughts, and manage their friend list.

### Key Features:

User Management: Users can create accounts, manage their profile information, and authenticate using secure login credentials.
Thought Sharing: Users can post their thoughts, which are stored in the database along with a timestamp.
Reaction System: Users can react to thoughts posted by their friends, expressing their emotions and opinions.
Friend Management: Users can build a friend list, add or remove friends, and view the thoughts of their friends.
Technologies Used:

- Express.js: A fast and minimalist web application framework for Node.js used for handling routing and middleware.
- MongoDB: A NoSQL document database used for storing user data, thoughts, and friend relationships.
- Mongoose: A MongoDB object modeling tool for Node.js used to simplify database operations and provide a schema-based solution.
- JavaScript Date Library: Optionally, you can utilize a JavaScript date library or the native JavaScript Date object to format timestamps.
- This API serves as the backend for the social network application, providing the necessary endpoints to create, read, update, and delete user accounts, thoughts, reactions, and friend relationships. It offers a scalable and efficient solution for building a feature-rich social networking platform.
